# TobaccoRetailerProjects

Description: Repository to house all data materials related to tobacco retail licensing and control. This repository is to demonstrate the skills I have in various data analysis tools using experience from my background as an epidemiologist/evaluator for a tobacco retail licensing program. Unless otherwise indicated, all data in this repository will utilize datasets generated by ChatGPT to prevent use of personally identifiable information.
